## SeetaFaceLib - A face image retrieval and recognition library based on SeetaFaceEngine

### [中文简介](doc/README_Chinese.md)

## Introduction
SeetaFaceLib is copied from [SeetaFaceEngine](https://github.com/seetaface/SeetaFaceEngine). I work in a Mac OS envirment, so I'd like to make the SeetaFaceEngine work in Mac OS. I have make some small changes to make it work in Xcode. What's more, I have also built a QT project of face image retrieval. The GUI of the QT project is designed as follows:

## Installation

The package of the SeetaFaceLib requires [SeetaFaceEngine]((https://github.com/seetaface/SeetaFaceEngine)) and [Falconn](https://github.com/FALCONN-LIB/FALCONN), and it has been tested on Mac OSX. SeetaFaceEngine is included in the SeetaFaceLib, so you just need Falconn package. Besides, you need a QT environment to run the QT project.
